# ITK 275 – Java as a 2nd Language
## Chapter 4 Programming Assignment

**Grade	50.0 (max 50.0)**

All of the java classes should be placed in a package named `edu.iltu.itk275.assignment4.<your ulid>`.  The class should be submitted as an attachment to this assignment.  They may be submitted individually or placed into a single archive (.zip) file.

Define a class named `Odometer` that will be used to track fuel and mileage for an automobile.  The class should have instance variables to track the miles driven and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon.  Include a mutator method to reset the
Odometer to zero miles, a mutator method to set the fuel efficiency, a mutator method that accepts miles driven for a trip and adds it to the odomoter’s total, and an accessor method that returns the number of gallons of gasoline that the vehicle has consumed since the odometer was last reset.

Use your class with a test application named `OdometerTest` that creates several trips with different fuel efficiencies.  You should decide which `Odometer` attributes should be public, if any.
