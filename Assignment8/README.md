# ITK 275 â€“ Java as a 2nd Language
## Chapter 8 Programming Assignment

All of the java classes should be placed in a package named `edu.iltu.itk275.assignment8.<your ulid>`.  The class should be submitted as an attachment to this assignment.  They may be submitted individually or placed into a single archive (.zip) file.

In the previous programming assignment, the `Alien` class was rewritten to use inheritance.  The rewritten `Alien` class should be made abstract because there will never be a need to create an instance of it, only its derived classes.  Change this to an abstract class and also make the `getDamage` method an abstract method.  Test the class from your main method to ensure that it still operates as expected.
