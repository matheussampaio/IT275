# ITK 275 – Java as a 2nd Language
## Chapter 2 Programming Assignment

**Grade	50.0 (max 50.0)**  

All of the java classes should be placed in a package named `edu.iltu.itk275.assignment2.<your ulid>`.  The class should be submitted as an attachment to this assignment.  They may be submitted individually or placed into a single archive (.zip) file.

Write a Java application that determines the change to be dispensed from a vending machine.  An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and 1 dollar in 5 cent increments (25, 30, 35, … 90, 95, 100) and the machine accepts only a single dollar bill to pay for the item. For example, a possible sample dialog might be the following:

```
Enter item name
`Pretzels`

Enter the price for `Pretzels`
`45`

You bought `Pretzels` for `45` cents and submitted a dollar, so our change is
2 Quarters
0 Dimes
1 Nickels
```
